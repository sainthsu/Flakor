/** @def FK_ENABLE_STACKABLE_ACTIONS
 If enabled, actions that alter the position property (eg: MoveBy, JumpBy, BezierBy, etc..) will be stacked.
 If you run 2 or more 'position' actions at the same time on a entity, then end position will be the sum of all the positions.
 If disabled, only the last run action will take effect.
 
 Enabled by default.

/** @def FK_ENABLE_GL_STATE_CACHE
 If enabled, FLAKOR will maintain an OpenGL state cache internally to avoid unnecessary switches.
 In order to use them, you have to use the following functions, instead of the the GL ones:
    - fkGLUseProgram() instead of glUseProgram()
    - fkGLDeleteProgram() instead of glDeleteProgram()
    - fkGLBlendFunc() instead of glBlendFunc()

 If this functionality is disabled, then fkGLUseProgram(), fkGLDeleteProgram(), fkGLBlendFunc() will call the GL ones, without using the cache.

 It is recommended to enable whenever possible to improve speed.
 If you are migrating your code from GL ES 1.1, then keep it disabled. Once all your code works as expected, turn it on.
 
 Default value: Enabled by default

/** @def FK_FIX_ARTIFACTS_BY_STRECHING_TEXEL
If enabled, the texture coordinates will be calculated by using this formula:

- texCoord.right = texCoord.left + (rect.size.width*2-2)/(texture.wide*2);

The same for bottom and top.

This formula prevents artifacts by using 99% of the texture.
The "correct" way to prevent artifacts is by using the spritesheet-artifact-fixer.py or a similar tool.

Affected nodes:
- Sprite / SpriteBatchNode and subclasses: LabelBMFont, TMXTiledMap
- LabelAtlas
- QuadParticleSystem
- TileMap

To enabled set it to 1. Disabled by default.
